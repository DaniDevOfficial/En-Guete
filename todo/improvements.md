i am not quiet certain about the always chekcing each validation one at a time maybe it would be better if i just had some sort of validateUser db query, which gives me the users information and his role in a specific group, so i dont need to chekc that again.


- [ ] update the delete user function to check if a user acctualy still exists or not
- [ ]
